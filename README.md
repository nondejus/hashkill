hashkill
========

Hashkill is an open-source password recovery tool. Its features are:

* Multi-threaded so that it can benefit from multi-core/multi-CPU systems
* SSE2/AVX/XOP/AES-NI-accelerated routines to achieve high speeds on modern x86 CPUs
* Very powerful rule engine plus optimized bruteforce/markov codepaths for fast algos.
* >60 plugins for different types of passwords (ranging from simple hashes like MD5 and SHA1 to WPA, passworded RAR files, MS Office documents and TrueCrypt volumes)
* Supports session save/restore. Sessions are auto-saved each 3 seconds. Password cracking can resume after the last checkpoint in case the program is stopped/killed/system crashes/power down/etc.
* Multi-hash support
* Fast GPU support on both Nvidia and AMD. GCN and Kepler architecture supported.
* Multi-GPU support (even AMD+NVidia systems).
